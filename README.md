# aoc-2022-kotlin

This is my attempt to solve advent of code 2022 kotlin puzzles. I am planning to push code for a day divided in commits. First commit will be orginal solution that I came with, second commit for that day will be more refined inspired by others but keeping touches of my own solution.

[^aoc]:
    [Advent of Code][aoc] â€“ An annual event of Christmas-oriented programming challenges started December 2015.
    Every year since then, beginning on the first day of December, a programming puzzle is published every day for twenty-five days.
    You can solve the puzzle and provide an answer using the language of your choice.
